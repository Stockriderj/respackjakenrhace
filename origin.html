            <h2>Gene Transfer</h2>

            <p class="article-paragraph">Respackjakenrhace does not live on this world. Well, not the mainland, anyway. See, the Respak origin
            story extends far beyond the Jenkaen Tribe, or even the Uytemuijil Tribe that came before it. Its people arrived to
            Pacifica long ago, while it was still inhabited by primitive Pacificans. Respakia, the Rhacenese's origin planet
            on, was ejected from its parent star system after it came too close to the Pacifican Solar System. It soon
            obtained an orbit around the Sun which crisscrossed through the orbits of Parva, Balteuma, Proxima...and Pacifica,
            which is the secondary protagonist in this interplanetary play.</p>

            <p class="article-paragraph">Now you're probably wondering, <i>"How did the ancient Rhacenese get from Respakia to Pacifica?"</i> Good
            question. It's an interesting story - and, as always, it starts with an asteroid. The asteroid, which Respak scientists now dub the <i>Respak-Pacifica Boat</i>, found its way to
            Respakia one day. It cut through the atmosphere at such a speed that it scraped off a chunk of the earth there,
            and it then exited the atmosphere of Respakia.</p>

            <p class="article-paragraph">As it turned out, the chunk of land it scraped off contained billions of Respak genes. These genes
            were then protected by the rock that had covered it; due to the friction from the impact, it had been morphed
            and fused itself over the air pocket with the genes in it. Coincidence? I think not.</p>

            <p class="article-paragraph"><i>Respak-Pacifica Boat</i> then found its way to Pacifica.</p>

            <p class="article-paragraph">The tiny asteroid hit the planet and the genes in the pocket burst out, infecting the population that lived there. However, Respak genes, you see, aren't the same
            as human genes. Although the Respak are extremely similar to humans nowadays due to all the evolution that
            occurred, their genes are built different. They can transfer memories. They can also broadcast thoughts to other
            Respaks if desired. So the Respak didn't even have to talk until meeting new species. They used this to
            communicate with their home planet Respakia as it spiraled into the orbit of Visi and became a natural
            satellite. This brings us into stage two of Respak history: evolution.</p>

            <h2>Two-World Evolution</h2>

            <p class="article-paragraph">So the Respak now live on two planets - great! Only, they don't. The genes had to first infect the native population. After this came millions of years of evolution that blended the Respak and human species together.</p>

            <p class="article-paragraph"><i>‚ÄùOkay, so they blended together on Pacifica. What about Respakia the home planet?‚Äù</i> Well, Respakia was evolving too. You see, Respak genes (as aforementioned) are not the same as human genes. They can be shared among other Respaks through a ‚Äúwireless‚Äù system.</p>

            <p class="article-paragraph">Unfortunately, as the two species mixed together, so did the species on Respakia - however, as humans couldn‚Äôt broadcast data to other humans, the Respak soon lost this ability, and it was completely gone during its final period of huge scientific advancement. This meant they had to reach to the skies, and beyond - which led to the discovery of Respakia.</p>

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>

            <p class="article-paragraph">What does this mean for us on NationStates? Well, basically nothing. However, just know the next time you see Respackjakenrhace on a Pacifican map, the real Respackjakenrhace is the size of a planet. That chunk of land you see right there is just an interplanetary embassy. üòâ</p>
