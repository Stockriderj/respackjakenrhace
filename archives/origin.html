            <h2>Early Ages</h2>

            <p class="article-paragraph">The home planet of the Respak is the planet of Respakia. This is a rather small planet, about 2/3 the size of Earth, with two moons. It was on this planet that most of the development of the Respak occured.</p>

            <p class="article-paragraph">Respakia, coincidentally, had a similar history of the Earth's. It was born when its original star, the Sitorr-Respakia, formed in a cloud of stardust. The astro debris then formed into Respakia. A few million years later, the planet turned into a rock, the atmosphere calmed down, and then, one day, some dust clumped together. In an epic chain of events, they fused into one, and the first living thing was created.</p>

            <p class="article-paragraph">Soon after, this thing managed to consume the air around it, which it then used to create water to maintain its bodily systems. It took the carbon dioxide from the air, took the oxygen out, and then pumped out the carbon through diffusion. The oxygen was then turned into water with the hydrogen found in the air, and then turned into water to sustain the being. Energy was generated easily by just grabbing it from the sunlight.</p>

            <p class="article-paragraph">After that stuff, all the fun evolution stuff happened and then the first Respak was born. The Rhacenese look quite like humans with similar anatomy, except they were taller due to the lower gravity. Their skin was not blue like in Avatar, however, if that's what's in your mind right now (lol ik thats not funny). It was mixed, just like humans.</p>

            <h2>Technological Development</h2>

            <p class="article-paragraph">The Respak history is unlike anything humanity has seen before. It was staggering. The Respak started out as cavemen, living in (no duh) caves and hunting the Biif (Respak bison basically). Then they discovered fire, which allowed them to get super smart. So far so normal, until they figured out how to farm in a record 1000 years!</p>
            
            <p class="article-paragraph">The Respak, you see, were extremely smart. They could connect things together very easily. A Respak caveman was about as smart as the average human Middle Ager.</p>

            <p class="article-paragraph">Using this advantage, they figured out how to farm extremely quickly. The wheel was invented shortly after. Then they figured out how to use metal from the ground to build stuff, and just a few decades later, engineering was already insane. They had social hierarchies, mines, and farms sprawling across the land.</p>

            <p class="article-paragraph">This is about the time the critical Jenspent Revolution occured. However, unlike the human history, the Respak</p>

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>

            <p class="article-paragraph">In conclusion, the true land of Respackjakenrhace is a planet that steers itself through the galaxy, making new colonies in its wake.</p>
